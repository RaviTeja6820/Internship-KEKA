            <p>Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise flow across borders. Where countries facilitate movement of goods and speed to market, customs exams, reduce red tape, and eliminate roadblocks. Where companies receive goods and merchandise directly into a Free Trade Zone without paying duties, fees, and taxes and then export products duty and tax free or imports from the Free Zone for domestic consumption.</p>
            <p>Free Trade Zones connects the commerce of North America, Europe, and Asia to Latin America and the Caribbean via direct air, sea, and over the road transportation links.</p>
